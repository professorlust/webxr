Introduction {#intro}
=============

<p class=non-normative>
Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications requires high-precision, low-latency interfaces to deliver an acceptable experience. Other interfaces, such as the {{RelativeOrientationSensor}} and {{AbsoluteOrientationSensor}}, can be repurposed to surface input from these devices to polyfill the WebXR Device API. The WebXR Device API provides purpose-built interfaces to VR/AR hardware to allow developers to build compelling, comfortable immersive experiences.
</p>

Terminology {#terminology}
===========

This document uses the acronym <b>XR</b> throughout to refer to the spectrum of hardware, applications, and techniques used for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and other related technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to:

 * Head mounted displays, whether they are opaque, transparent, or utilize video passthrough
 * Mobile devices with positional tracking
 * Fixed displays with head tracking capabilities

The important commonality between them being that they offer some degree of spatial tracking with which to simulate a view of virtual content.

Terms like "XR Device", "XR Application", etc. are generally understood to apply to any of the above. Portions of this document that only apply to a subset of these devices will indicate so as appropriate.

The terms [=3DoF=] and [=6DoF=] are used throughout this document to describe the tracking capabilities of XR devices.

 - A <dfn>3DoF</dfn> device, short for "Three Degrees of Freedom", is one that can only track rotational movement. This is common in devices which rely exclusively on accelerometer and gyroscope readings to provide tracking. [=3DoF=] devices do not respond translational movements from the user, though they may employ algorithms to estimate translational changes based on modeling of the neck or arms.
 - A <dfn>6DoF</dfn> device, short for "Six Degrees of Freedom", is one that can track both rotation and translation, enabling for precise 1:1 tracking in space. This typically requires some level of understanding of the user's environment. That environmental understanding may be achived via inside-out tracking, where sensors on the tracked device itself (such as cameras or depth sensors) are used to determine the device's position, or outside-in tracking, where external devices placed in the user's environment (like a camera or light emmiting device) provides a stable point of reference against which the XR device can determine it's position.


Security, Privacy, and Comfort Considerations {#security}
=============================================

The WebXR Device API provides powerful new features which bring with them several unique privacy, security, and comfort risks that user agents must take steps to mitigate.

Gaze Tracking {#gazetracking-security}
-------------

While the API does not yet expose eye tracking capabilites a lot can be inferred about where the user is looking by tracking the orientation of their head. This is especially true of XR devices that have limited input capabilities, such as Google Cardboard, which frequently require users to control a "gaze cursor" with their head orientation. This means that it may be possible for a malicious page to infer what a user is typing on a virtual keyboard or how they are interacting with a virtual UI based solely on monitoring their head movements. For example: if not prevented from doing so a page could estimate what URL a user is entering into the user agent's URL bar.

To prevent this risk the user agent MUST [=blur all sessions=] when the users is interacting with sensitive, trusted UI such as URL bars or system dialogs. Additionally, to prevent a malicious page from being able to monitor input on a other pages the user agent MUST [=blur all sessions=] on non-focused pages.

Trusted Environment {#trustedenvironment-security}
-------------------

If the virtual environment does not consistently track the user's head motion with low latency and at a high frame rate the user may become disoriented or physically ill. Since it is impossible to force pages to produce consistently performant and correct content the user agent MUST provide a tracked, trusted environment and an [=XR Compositor=] which runs asynchronously from page content. The compositor is responsible for compositing the trusted and untrusted content. If content is not performant, does not submit frames, or terminates unexpectedly the user agent should be able to continue presenting a responsive, trusted UI.

Additionally, page content has the ability to make users uncomfortable in ways not related to performance. Badly applied tracking, strobing colors, and content intended to offend, frighten, or intimidate are examples of content which may cause the user to want to quickly exit the XR experience. Removing the XR device in these cases may not always be a fast or practical option. To accomodate this the user agent SHOULD provide users with an action, such as pressing a reserved hardware button or performing a gesture, that escapes out of WebXR content and displays the user agent's trusted UI.

When navigating between pages in XR the user agent should display trusted UI elements informing the user of the security information of the site they are navigating to which is normally presented by the 2D UI, such as the URL and encryption status.

Context Isolation {#contextisolation-security}
-----------------

The trusted UI must be drawn by an independent rendering context whose state is isolated from any rendering contexts used by the page. (For example, any WebGL rendering contexts.) This is to prevent the page from corrupting the state of the trusted UI's context, which may prevent it from properly rendering a tracked environment. It also prevents the possibility of the page being able to capture imagery from the trusted UI, which could lead to private information being leaked.

Also, to prevent CORS-related vulnerabilities each page will see a new instance of objects returned by the API, such as {{XRSession}}. Attributes such as the {{XRWebGLLayer/context}} set by one page must not be able to be read by another. Similarly, methods invoked on the API MUST NOT cause an observable state change on other pages. For example: No method will be exposed that enables a system-level orientation reset, as this could be called repeatedly by a malicious page to prevent other pages from tracking properly. The user agent MUST, however, respect system-level orientation resets triggered by a user gesture or system menu.

Fingerprinting {#fingerprinting-security}
--------------

Given that the API describes hardware available to the user and its capabilities it will inevitably provide additional surface area for fingerprinting. While it's impossible to completely avoid this, steps can be taken to mitigate the issue. This spec limits reporting of available hardware to only a single device at a time, which prevents using the rare cases of multiple headsets being connected as a fingerprinting signal. Also, the devices that are reported have no string identifiers and expose very little information about the devices capabilities until an XRSession is created, which may only be triggered via user activation in the most sensitive case.

Issue: Discuss use of sensor activity as a possible fingerprinting vector.

Initialization {#initialization}
===================

XR {#xr-interface}
----

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XR : EventTarget {
  // Methods
  Promise&lt;void&gt; supportsSessionMode(XRSessionMode mode);
  Promise&lt;XRSession&gt; requestSession(optional XRSessionCreationOptions parameters);

  // Events
  attribute EventHandler ondevicechange;
};

[SecureContext]
partial interface Navigator {
  [SameObject] readonly attribute XR xr;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for="Navigator">xr</dfn> object is the entry point to the API, used to query for XR features available to the user agent. It has a <dfn>list of XR devices</dfn>, which MUST be initially empty, and an <dfn>XR device</dfn> which MUST be initially <code>null</code> and represents the active device from the [=list of XR devices=] that API calls will interact with.

The user agent MUST be able to <dfn>enumerate XR devices</dfn> attached to the system, at which time each available device is placed in the [=list of XR devices=]. Subsequent algorithms requesting enumeration MAY reuse the cached [=list of XR devices=]. Enumerating the devices [=should not initialize device tracking=]. After the first enumeration the user agent SHOULD begin monitoring device connection and disconnection, adding connected devices to the [=list of XR devices=] and removing disconnected devices.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="xr-device-selection">

Each time the [=list of XR devices=] changes the user agent should <dfn>select an XR device</dfn> by running the following steps:

  1. Let |oldDevice| be the current [=XR device=].
  1. If the [=list of XR devices=] is empty, set the [=XR device=] to <code>null</code>.
  1. If the [=list of XR devices=] contains one device set the [=XR device=] to that device.
  1. If there are any active {{XRSession}}s and |oldDevice| is in the [=list of XR devices=], set the [=XR device=] to |oldDevice|.
  1. Else set the [=XR device=] to a device of the user agent's choosing.
  1. If this is the first time devices have been enumerated or |oldDevice| equals [=XR device=], abort these steps. 
  1. [=Shut down the session|Shut down=] any active {{XRSession}}s.
  1. Set the [=XR compatible=] boolean of all {{WebGLRenderingContextBase}} instances to <code>false</code>.
  1. Queue a task that fires a simple event named {{devicechange}} on the {{XR}} object.

</div>

NOTE: The user agent is allowed to use any criteria it wishes to [=select an XR device=] when the [=list of XR devices=] contains multiple devices. For example, the user agent may always select the first item in the list, or provide settings UI that allows users to manage device priority. Ideally the algorithm used to select the default device is stable and will result in the same device being selected across multiple browsing sessions.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="ensure-device-selected">

Any time an [=XR device=] is needed by an algorithm it can <dfn>ensure an XR device is selected</dfn> by running the following steps:

  1. If [=XR device=] is not <code>null</code>, abort these steps. 
  1. [=Enumerate XR devices=].
  1. [=Select an XR device=].

</div>

The <dfn attribute for="XR">ondevicechange</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{devicechange}} event type.

Each [=XR device=] has a <dfn>list of supported modes</dfn>, which MUST contain all of the {{XRSessionMode}} types that the [=XR device=] can support, and MUST contain {{inline}}.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="supports-session-mode">

When the <dfn method for="XR">supportsSessionMode(|mode|)</dfn> method is invoked, it MUST return [=a new Promise=] |promise| and run the following steps [=in parallel=]:

  1. [=Ensure an XR device is selected=].
  1. If [=XR device=] is <code>null</code>, [=reject=] |promise| with a {{NotSupportedError}} and abort these steps.
  1. If |mode| is in not in [=XR device=]'s [=list of supported modes=], [=reject=] |promise| with a {{NotSupportedError}} and abort these steps.
  1. Else [=/resolve=] |promise|.

</div>

Calling {{XR/supportsSessionMode()}} MUST NOT trigger device-selection UI as this would cause many sites to display XR-specific dialogs early in the document lifecycle without user activation.

<div class="example">

The {{XR}} object has a <dfn>pending immersive session</dfn> boolean, which MUST be initially <code>false</code>, an <dfn>active immersive session</dfn>, which MUST be initially <code>null</code>, and a <dfn>list of inline sessions</dfn>, which MUST be initially empty.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="request-session">

Session {#session}
=======

XRSessionMode {#xrsessionmode-enum}
-------------------------

<pre class="idl">
enum XRSessionMode {
  "inline",
  "immersive-vr",
  "immersive-ar"
};
</pre>

The {{XRSessionMode}} enum defines the modes that an {{XRSession}} can operate in.

  - A session mode of <dfn enum-value for="XRSessionMode">inline</dfn> indicates that the session's output will be shown as an element in the HTML document. {{inline}} session content MAY be displayed in mono or stereo and MAY allow for [=viewer=] tracking. User agents MUST allow {{inline}} sessions to be created for any [=XR device=].
  - A session mode of <dfn enum-value for="XRSessionMode">immersive-vr</dfn> indicates that the session's output will be given [=exclusive access=] to the [=XR device=] display and that content <b>is not</b> intended to be integrated with the user's environment. The {{environmentBlendMode}} for {{immersive-vr}} sessions is expected to be {{opaque}} when possible, but MAY be {{additive}} if the hardware requires it.
  -  A session mode of <dfn enum-value for="XRSessionMode">immersive-ar</dfn> indicates that the session's output will be given [=exclusive access=] to the [=XR device=] display and that content <b>is</b> intended to be integrated with the user's environment. The {{environmentBlendMode}} MUST NOT be {{opaque}} for {{immersive-ar}} sessions.

An <dfn>immersive session</dfn> refers to either an {{immersive-vr}} or an {{immersive-ar}} session. [=Immersive sessions=] MUST provide some level of [=viewer=] tracking, and content MUST be shown at the proper scale relative to the user and/or the surrounding environment. Additionally, [=Immersive sessions=] MUST be given <dfn>exclusive access</dfn> to the [=XR device=], meaning that while the [=immersive session=] is not [=blurred=] the HTML document is not shown on the [=XR device=]'s display, nor is content from other applications shown.

NOTE: Examples of ways [=exclusive access=] may be presented include stereo content displayed on a virtual reality or augmented reality headset, or augmented reality content displayed fullscreen on a mobile device.

Issue: Document restrictions and capabilities of [=immersive session=]s.

Issue: Describe the different ways that immersive content can be displayed better.

XRSessionCreationOptions {#xrsessioncreationoptions-interface}
-------------------------

<pre class="idl">
dictionary XRSessionCreationOptions {
  XRSessionMode mode = "inline";
  XRPresentationContext outputContext;
};
</pre>

The {{XRSessionCreationOptions}} dictionary provides a <dfn>session description</dfn>, indicating the desired properties of a session to be returned from {{requestSession()}}.

XRSession {#xrsession-interface}
---------

<pre class="idl">
enum XREnvironmentBlendMode {
  "opaque",
  "additive",
  "alpha-blend",
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRSession : EventTarget {
  // Attributes
  readonly attribute XRSessionMode mode;
  readonly attribute XRPresentationContext outputContext;
  readonly attribute XREnvironmentBlendMode environmentBlendMode;

  attribute double depthNear;
  attribute double depthFar;
  attribute XRLayer baseLayer;

  // Methods
  Promise&lt;XRFrameOfReference&gt; requestFrameOfReference(XRFrameOfReferenceType type, optional XRFrameOfReferenceOptions options);

  FrozenArray&lt;XRInputSource&gt; getInputSources();

  long requestAnimationFrame(XRFrameRequestCallback callback);
  void cancelAnimationFrame(long handle);

  Promise&lt;void&gt; end();

  // Events
  attribute EventHandler onblur;
  attribute EventHandler onfocus;
  attribute EventHandler onend;
  attribute EventHandler onselect;
  attribute EventHandler oninputsourceschange;
  attribute EventHandler onselectstart;
  attribute EventHandler onselectend;
};
</pre>

Any interaction with XR hardware is done via an {{XRSession}} object, which can only be retrieved by calling {{requestSession()}} on the {{XR}} object. Once a session has been successfully acquired it can be used to [=poll the device pose=], query information about the user's environment and, present imagery to the user.

The user agent, when possible, <dfn>SHOULD NOT initialize device tracking</dfn> or rendering capabilities until an {{XRSession}} has been acquired. This is to prevent unwanted side effects of engaging the XR systems when they're not actively being used, such as increased battery usage or related utility applications from appearing when first navigating to a page that only wants to test for the presence of XR hardware in order to advertise XR features. Not all XR platforms offer ways to detect the hardware's presence without initializing tracking, however, so this is only a strong recommendation.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="initialize-session">

When an {{XRSession}} is created, the user agent MUST <dfn>initialize the session</dfn> by running the following steps:

  1. Let |session| be the newly created {{XRSession}} object.
  1. Let |options| be the {{XRSessionCreationOptions}} passed to {{requestSession()}}.
  1. Initialize |session|'s {{XRSession/mode}} to |options| {{XRSessionCreationOptions/mode}} value.
  1. Initialize |session|'s {{XRSession/outputContext}} to |options| {{XRSessionCreationOptions/outputContext}} value.
  1. Initialize |session|'s {{XRSession/depthNear}} to <code>0.1</code>.
  1. Initialize |session|'s {{XRSession/depthFar}} to <code>1000.0</code>.
  1. Initialize |session|'s {{XRSession/baseLayer}} to <code>null</code>.
  1. If no other features of the user agent have done so already, perform the necessary platform-specific steps to initialize the device's tracking and rendering capabilities.

</div>

A number of diffrent circumstances may <dfn>shut down the session</dfn>, which is permanent and irreversable. Once a session has been shut down the only way to access the [=XR device=]'s tracking or rendering capabilities again is to request a new session. Each {{XRSession}} has an <dfn>ended</dfn> boolean, initially set to <code>false</code>, that indicates if it has been shut down.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="shut-down-session">

When an {{XRSession}} is shut down the following steps are run:

  1. Let |session| be the target {{XRSession}} object.
  1. Set |session|'s [=ended=] value to <code>true</code>.
  1. If the [=active immersive session=] is equal to |session|, set the [=active immersive session=] to <code>null</code>.
  1. Remove |session| from the [=list of inline sessions=].
  1. If no other features of the user agent are actively using them, perform the necessary platform-specific steps to shut down the device's tracking and rendering capabilities.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="end-session">

The <dfn method for="XRSession">end()</dfn> method provides a way to manually shut down a session. When invoked, it MUST return [=a new Promise=] |promise| and run the following steps [=in parallel=]:

  1. [=Shut down the session|Shut down=] the target {{XRSession}} object.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |promise|.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="request-frame-of-reference">

When the <dfn method for="XRSession">requestFrameOfReference(|options|)</dfn> method is invoked, the user agent MUST return [=a new Promise=] |promise| and run the following steps [=in parallel=]:

  1. [=Create a frame of reference=], |frameOfRef|, as described by |options|.
  1. If |frameOfRef| is <code>null</code>, [=reject=] |promise| with a {{NotSupportedError}} and abort these steps.
  1. [=/Resolve=] |promise| with |frameOfRef|.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="get-input-sources">

When the <dfn method for="XRSession">getInputSources()</dfn> method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:

  1. Return the current [=list of active input sources=].

</div>

Each {{XRSession}} has a <dfn>environment blending mode</dfn> value, which is a enum which MUST be set to whichever of the following values best matches the behavior of imagery rendered by the session in relation to the user's surrounding environment.

  - A blend mode of <dfn enum-value for="XREnvironmentBlendMode">opaque</dfn> indicates that the user's surrounding environment is not visible at all. Alpha values in the {{XRSession/baseLayer}} will be ignored, with the compositor treating all alpha values as 1.0.

  - A blend mode of <dfn enum-value for="XREnvironmentBlendMode">additive</dfn> indicates that the user's surrounding environment is visible and the {{XRSession/baseLayer}} will be shown additively against it. Alpha values in the {{XRSession/baseLayer}} will be ignored, with the compositor treating all alpha values as 1.0. When this blend mode is in use black pixels will appear fully transparent, and there is no way to make a pixel appear fully opaque.

  - A blend mode of <dfn enum-value for="XREnvironmentBlendMode">alpha-blend</dfn> indicates that the user's surrounding environment is visible and the {{XRSession/baseLayer}} will be blended with it according to the alpha values of each pixel. Pixels with an alpha value of 1.0 will be fully opaque and pixels with an alpha value of 0.0 will be fully transparent.

The <dfn attribute for="XRSession">environmentBlendMode</dfn> attribute returns the {{XRSession}}'s [=environment blending mode=]

NOTE: Most Virtual Reality devices exhibit {{XREnvironmentBlendMode/opaque}} blending behavior. Augmented Reality devices that use transparent optical elements frequently exhibit {{XREnvironmentBlendMode/additive}} blending behavior, and Augmented Reality devices that use passthrough cameras frequently exhibit {{XREnvironmentBlendMode/alpha-blend}} blending behavior.

The <dfn attribute for="XRSession">onblur</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{blur}} event type.

The <dfn attribute for="XRSession">onfocus</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{focus}} event type.

The <dfn attribute for="XRSession">onend</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{end}} event type.

The <dfn attribute for="XRSession">oninputsourceschange</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{inputsourceschange}} event type.

Animation Frames {#animation-frames}
----------------

<pre class="idl">

</pre>

Each {{XRFrameRequestCallback}} object has a <dfn for="XRFrameRequestCallback">cancelled</dfn> boolean initially set to <code>false</code>.

Each {{XRSession}} has a <dfn>list of animation frame callbacks</dfn>, which is initially empty, and an <dfn>animation frame callback identifier</dfn>, which is a number initially be zero.

The XR Compositor {#compositor}
-----------------

Issue: This needs to be broken up a bit more and more clearly decribe things such as the frame lifecycle.

The user agent MUST maintain an <dfn>XR Compositor</dfn> which handles presentation to the [=XR device=] and frame timing. The compositor MUST use an independent rendering context whose state is isolated from that of any WebGL contexts used as {{XRWebGLLayer}} sources to prevent the page from corrupting the compositor state or reading back content from other pages. the compositor MUST also run in separate thread or processes to decouple performance of the page from the ability to present new imagery to the user at the appropriate framerate.

The [=XR Compositor=] has a list of layer images, which is initially empty.

<!--There are no direct interfaces to the compositor, but applications may submit bitmaps to be composited via the layer system and observe the frame timing via calls to {{XRSession/requestAnimationFrame()}}. The compositor consists of two different loops, assumed to be running in separate threads or processes. The <dfn>Frame Loop</dfn>, which drives the page script, and the <dfn>Render Loop</dfn>, which continuously presents imagery provided by the Frame Loop to the XR device. The render loop maintains its own copy of the session's layer list. Communication between the two loops is synchronized with a lock that limits access to the render loop's layer list.

Both loops are started when a session is successfully created. The compositor's render loop goes through the following steps:

  1. The layer lock is acquired.
  1. The render loop's layer list images are composited and presented to the device.
  1. The layer lock is released.
  1. Notify the frame loop that a frame has been completed.
  1. return to step 1.

The render loop MUST throttle its throughput to the refresh rate of the XR device. The exact point in the loop that is most effective to block at may differ between platforms, so no perscription is made for when that should happen.

Upon session creation, the following steps are taken to start the frame loop:

  1. A new promise is created and set as the session's current frame promise. The current frame promise is returned any time XRCanvasLayer/commit() is called.
  1. The {{sessionchange}} event is fired.
  1. The promise returned from {{requestSession()}} is resolved.

Then, the frame loop performs the following steps while the session is active:

  1. The render loop's layer lock is acquired.
  1. Any dirty layers in the session's layer list are copied to the render loop's layer list.
  1. The render loop's layer lock is released.
  1. Wait for the render loop to signal that a frame has been completed.
  1. The session's current frame promise is set as the the previous frame promise.
  1. A new promise is created and set as the session's current frame promise.
  1. The previous frame promise is resolved.
  1. Once the promise has been resolved, return to step 1.-->

XRCoordinateSystem {#xrcoordinatesystem-interface}
------------------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRCoordinateSystem {
  Float32Array? getTransformTo(XRCoordinateSystem other);
};
</pre>

An {{XRCoordinateSystem}} describes an entity that is tracked by the [=XR device=]'s tracking systems. {{XRCoordinateSystem}}s MAY NOT have a fixed spatial relationship to one another or to any given {{XRFrameOfReference}}. The transform between two {{XRCoordinateSystem}} can be evaluated by calling the {{getTransformTo()}} method every [=animation frame=].

XRFrameOfReference {#xrframeofreference-interface}
------------------

<pre class="idl">
enum XRFrameOfReferenceType {

  required XRFrameOfReferenceType type;
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRFrameOfReference : EventTarget {
  readonly attribute XRCoordinateSystem coordinateSystem;
  
  attribute EventHandler onreset;
};
</pre>

An {{XRFrameOfReference}} describes an {{XRCoordinateSystem}} that is generally expected to remain static for the duration of the {{XRSession}}, with the most common exception being mid-session reconfiguration by the user.

Every {{XRFrameOfReference}} describes a coordinate system where the Y axis MUST be aligned with gravity, with positive Y being "Up". Negative Z is considered "Forward", and positive X is considered "Right". Each {{XRFrameOfReference}} has as <dfn for="XRFrameOfReference">session</dfn>, which is the {{XRSession}} that created it.

An {{XRFrameOfReference}} is obtained by calling {{XRSession/requestFrameOfReference()}}, which creates an instance of an interface extending {{XRFrameOfReference}}, determined by the {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} value of the {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions}} dictionary passed into the call:

  - Passing a {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRFrameOfReferenceType">stationary</dfn> creates an {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} instance.

  - Passing a {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRFrameOfReferenceType">bounded</dfn> creates an {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}} instance if supported by the [=XR device=].

  - Passing a {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRFrameOfReferenceType">unbounded</dfn> creates an {{XRUnboundedFrameOfReference}} instance if supported by the [=XR device=].

The <dfn attribute for="XRFrameOfReference">onreset</dfn> attribute is an [=Event handler IDL attribute=] for the {{reset}} event type.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="create-frame-of-reference">

When an {{XRFrameOfReference}} is requested, the user agent MUST <dfn>create a frame of reference</dfn> by running the following steps:

  1. Initialize [=XRFrameOfReference/session=] be the {{XRSession}} object that requested creation of a frame of reference.
  1. Let |options| be the {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions}} passed to {{requestFrameOfReference()}}.
  1. Let |type| be set to |options| {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}}.

Issue: Describe circumstances when a frame of reference type might be rejected.

XRStationaryFrameOfReference {#xrstationaryframeofreference-interface}
----------------------------

<pre class="idl">
enum XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype {
  "eye-level",
  "floor-level",

};

dictionary XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceOptions : XRFrameOfReferenceOptions {
  required XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype subtype;
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRStationaryFrameOfReference : XRFrameOfReference {
  readonly attribute XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype subtype;
};
</pre>

An {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} represents a tracking space that the user is not expected to move around within. Tracking in a {{stationary}} frame of reference is optimized for keeping the frame of reference origin stable relative to the environment.

There are several subtypes of {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}}, determined by the {{XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceOptions/subtype}} value of the {{XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceOptions}} dictionary passed into the {{requestFrameOfReference()}} call:

- Passing a {{XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceOptions/subtype}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype">eye-level</dfn> creates an {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} with it's origin near the user's head at the time of creation. The exact position and orientation will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform.

- Passing a {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype">floor-level</dfn> creates an {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} with it's origin positioned at the floor in a safe position for the user to stand. The `y` axis equals `0` at floor level, with the `x` and `z` position and orientation initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform. If the floor level isn't known it will be estimated.

- Passing a {{XRFrameOfReferenceOptions/type}} of <dfn enum-value for="XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype">position-disabled</dfn> creates an {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} where orientation is tracked but the [=viewer=]s position is always reported as being at the origin.

Note: The {{position-disabled}} subtype is primarily intended for use with pre-rendered media such as panoramic photos or videos. It should not be used for most other media types due to user discomfort associated with the lack of a neck model or full positional tracking.

The {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}}'s <dfn attribute for="XRBoundedFrameOfReference">subtype</dfn> attribute is the {{XRStationaryFrameOfReferenceSubtype}} that the {{XRStationaryFrameOfReference}} was created with.

XRBoundedFrameOfReference {#xrboundedframeofreference-interface}
----------------------------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRBoundedFrameOfReference : XRFrameOfReference {
  readonly attribute FrozenArray&lt;DOMPointReadOnly&gt; boundsGeometry;
};    
</pre>

An {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}} represents a floor-relative tracking space where the user is expected to move within a pre-established boundary. In order to ensure user safety tracking in an {{bounded}} frame of reference is optimized for keeping the frame of reference origin and bounds geometry stable relative to the environment. Other XR platforms sometimes refer to this as "room scale" tracking.

The origin of a {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}} MUST be positioned at the floor, such that the `y` axis equals `0` at floor level. The `x` and `z` position and orientation are initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform, typically expected to be near the center of the room facing in a logical forward direction.

Note: An {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}} is not intended to describe multi-room spaces, areas with uneven floor levels, or very large open areas. Content that needs to handle those scenarios should use an {{XRUnboundedFrameOfReference}}.

The <dfn attribute for="XRBoundedFrameOfReference">boundsGeometry</dfn> attribute describes the border around the {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}}, which the user can expect to safely move within. 

The polygonal boundary is given as an array of {{DOMPointReadOnly}}s, which represents a loop of points at the edges of the safe space. The points describe offsets from the {{XRFrameOfReference}} origin in meters, but MAY not contain the origin. Points MUST be given in a clockwise order as viewed from above, looking towards the negative end of the Y axis. The {{DOMPointReadOnly/y}} value of each point MUST be <code>0</code> and the {{DOMPointReadOnly/w}} value of each point MUST be <code>1</code>. The bounds can be considered to originate at the floor and extend infinitely high. The shape it describes MAY not be convex.

Note: Content should not require the user to move beyond the {{boundsGeometry}}. It is possible for the user to move beyond the bounds if their physical surroundings allow for it, resulting in position values outside of the polygon they describe. This is not an error condition and should be handled gracefully by page content.

Note: Content generally should not provide a visualization of the {{boundsGeometry}}, as it's the user agent's responsibility to ensure that safety critical information is provided to the user.

XRUnboundedFrameOfReference {#xrunboundedframeofreference-interface}
----------------------------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] 
interface XRUnboundedFrameOfReference : XRFrameOfReference {
};  
</pre>

An {{XRUnboundedFrameOfReference}} represents a tracking space where the user is expected to move freely around their environment, potentially even long distances from their starting point. Tracking in an {{unbounded}} frame of reference is optimized for stability around the user's current position, and as such the tracking origin may drift over time.

Views {#views}
=====

XRView {#xrview-interface}
------

<pre class="idl">
enum XREye {
  "left",
  "right"
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRView {
  readonly attribute XREye eye;
  readonly attribute Float32Array projectionMatrix;
  readonly attribute Float32Array viewMatrix;
};
</pre>

An {{XRView}} describes a single <dfn>view</dfn> into an XR scene. Each [=view=] corresponds to a display or portion of a display used by an XR device to present imagery to the user. They are used to retrieve all the information necessary to render content that is well aligned to the [=view=]'s physical output properties, including the field of view, eye offset, and other optical properties. [=Views=] may cover overlapping regions of the user's vision. No guarantee is made about the number of [=views=] any XR device uses or their order, nor is the number of [=views=] required to be constant for the duration of an {{XRSession}}.

NOTE: Many HMDs will request that content render two [=views=], one for the left eye and one for the right, while most magic window devices will only request one [=view=], but applications should never assume a specific view comfiguration. For example: A magic window device may request two views if it is capable of stereo output, but may revert to requesting a single view for performance reasons if the stereo output mode is turned off. Similarly, HMDs may request more than two views to facilitate a wide field of view or displays of different pixel density.

The <dfn attribute for="XRView">eye</dfn> attribute describes which eye this view is expected to be shown to. This attribute's primary purpose is to ensure that prerendered stereo content can present the correct portion of the content to the correct eye. If the view does not have an intrinsicly associated eye (the display is monoscopic, for example) this attribute MUST be set to {{XREye/"left"}}.

The <dfn attribute for="XRView">projectionMatrix</dfn> attribute provides a [=matrix=] describing the projection to be used when rendering the [=view=]. It is <b>strongly recommended</b> that applications use this matrix without modification. Failure to use the provided projection matrices when rendering may cause the presented frame to be distorted or badly aligned, resulting in varying degrees of user discomfort.

The <dfn attribute for="XRView">viewMatrix</dfn> attribute provides a [=matrix=]
describing the view transform to be used  when rendering the [=view=]. The [=matrix=] represent the inverse of the model matrix of the associated viewpoint. It is <b>strongly recommended</b> that applications use this matrix without modification. Failure to use the provided view matrices when rendering may cause the presented frame to be distorted or badly aligned, resulting in varying degrees of user discomfort.

XRViewport {#xrviewport-interface}
------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRViewport {
  readonly attribute long x;
  readonly attribute long y;
  readonly attribute long width;
  readonly attribute long height;
};
</pre>

An {{XRViewport}} object describes a viewport, or rectangular region, of a graphics surface. The <dfn attribute for="XRViewport">x</dfn> and <dfn attribute for="XRViewport">y</dfn> attributes define an offset from the surface origin and the <dfn attribute for="XRViewport">width</dfn> and <dfn attribute for="XRViewport">height</dfn> attributes define the rectangular dimensions of the viewport.

The exact interpretation of the viewport values depends on the conventions of the graphics API the viewport is associated with:

 - When used with a {{XRWebGLLayer}} the {{XRViewport/x}} and {{XRViewport/y}} attributes specify the lower left corner of the viewport rectangle, in pixels, with the viewport rectangle extending {{XRViewport/width}} pixels to the right of {{XRViewport/x}} and {{XRViewport/height}} pixels above {{XRViewport/y}}. The values can be passed to the [=WebGL viewport=] function directly.

<div class="example">
The following code sets the [=WebGL viewport=] for an {{XRWebGLLayer}}'s framebuffer using an {{XRViewport}} retrieved from an {{XRView}}.

<pre highlight="js">
xrSession.requestAnimationFrame((time, xrFrame) => {
  let xrView = xrFrame.views[0];
  let xrViewport = xrWebGLLayer.getViewport(xrView);

  gl.bindFramebuffer(xrWebGLLayer.framebuffer);
  gl.viewport(xrViewport.x, xrViewport.y, xrViewport.width, xrViewport.height);

  // WebGL draw calls will now be rendered into the appropriate viewport.
});

</div>

Pose {#pose}
====

Matrices {#matrices}
--------

WebXR provides various transforms in the form of <dfn lt="matrix">matrices</dfn>. WebXR matrices are always 4x4 and given as 16 element {{Float32Array}}s in column major order. They may be passed directly to WebGL's {{uniformMatrix4fv}} function, used to create an equivalent {{DOMMatrix}}, or used with a variety of third party math libraries.

Translations specified by WebXR matrices are always given in meters.

XRViewerPose {#xrviewerpose-interface}
-------------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRViewerPose {
  readonly attribute Float32Array poseMatrix;
  readonly attribute FrozenArray&lt;XRView&gt; views;
};
</pre>

An {{XRViewerPose}} describes the state of a <dfn>viewer</dfn> of the XR scene as tracked by the [=XR device=]. A [=viewer=] may represent a tracked piece of hardware, the observed position of a users head relative to the hardware, or some other means of computing a series of viewpoints into the XR scene. The {{XRViewerPose}} describes the position and orientation of the [=viewer=] relative to the {{XRFrameOfReference}} it was queried with, as well as an array of [=view=]s, which include view and projection matrices. These matrices should be used by the application when render a frame of an XR scene.

The <dfn attribute for="XRViewerPose">poseMatrix</dfn> is a [=matrix=] describing the transform from the origin of the {{XRFrameOfReference}} the {{XRViewerPose}} was queried with to the [=viewer=].

NOTE: The {{XRViewerPose/poseMatrix}} can be used to position graphical representations of the [=viewer=] for spectator views of the scene or multi-user interaction.

The <dfn attribute for="XRViewerPose">views</dfn> array is a sequence of {{XRView}}s describing the viewpoints of the XR scene, relative to the {{XRFrameOfReference}} the {{XRViewerPose}} was queried with. Every [=view=] of the XR scene in the array must be rendered in order to display correctly on the [=XR device=]. Each {{XRView}} includes view and projection matrices, and can be used to query {{XRViewport}}s from layers when needed.

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRInputSource {
  readonly attribute XRHandedness handedness;
  readonly attribute XRTargetRayMode targetRayMode;
};
</pre>

Each {{XRInputSource}} SHOULD define a <dfn>primary action</dfn>. The [=primary action=] is a platform-specific action that, when engaged, produces {{selectstart}}, {{selectend}}, and {{XRSession/select}} events. Examples of possible [=primary action=]s are pressing a trigger, touchpad, or button, speaking a command, or making a hand gesture. If the platform guidelines define a recommended primary input then it should be used as the [=primary action=], otherwise the user agent is free to select one.

The <dfn attribute for="XRInputSource">handedness</dfn> attribute describes which hand the input source is associated with, if any. Input sources with no natural handedness (such as headset-mounted controls or standard gamepads) or for which the handedness is not currently known MUST set this attribute to the empty string.

The <dfn attribute for="XRInputSource">targetRayMode</dfn> attribute describes the method used to produce the target ray, and indicates how the application should present the target ray to the user if desired.

  - <dfn enum-value for="XRTargetRayMode">gaze</dfn> indicates the target ray will originate at the user's head and follow the direction they are looking (this is commonly referred to as a "gaze input" device).
  - <dfn enum-value for="XRTargetRayMode">tracked-pointer</dfn> indicates that the target ray originates from either a handheld device or other hand-tracking mechanism and represents that the user is using their hands or the held device for pointing.
  - <dfn enum-value for="XRTargetRayMode">screen</dfn> indicates that the input source was an interaction with the canvas element associated with a inline session's output context, such as a mouse click or touch event.

Note: Some input sources, like an {{XRInputSource}} with {{targetRayMode}} set to {{screen}}, will only be added to the session's [=list of active input sources=] immediately before the {{selectstart}} event, and removed from the session's [=list of active input sources=] immediately after the {{selectend}} event.

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface XRRay {
  readonly attribute DOMPointReadOnly origin;

</pre>

An {{XRRay}} describes a geometric ray. The <dfn attribute for="XRRay">origin</dfn> attribute defines the 3-dimensional point in space that the ray originates from. The {{XRRay/origin}}'s {{DOMPointReadOnly/w}} attribute MUST be <code>1.0</code>. The <dfn attribute for="XRRay">direction</dfn> attribute defines the ray's 3-dimensional directional vector. The {{direction}}'s {{DOMPointReadOnly/w}} attribute MUST be <code>0.0</code> and the vector MUST be normalized to have a length of <code>1.0</code>.

The <dfn attribute for="XRRay">transformMatrix</dfn> is a [=matrix=] which represents the transform from a ray originating at <code>[0, 0, 0]</code> and extending down the negative Z axis to the ray described by the {{XRRay}}'s {{XRRay/origin}} and {{direction}}.

NOTE: The {{XRRay}}'s {{XRRay/transformMatrix}} can be used to easily position graphical representations of the ray when rendering.

The <dfn attribute for="XRInputPose">emulatedPosition</dfn> attribute indicates the accuracy of the {{XRRay/origin}} of the {{XRInputPose/targetRay}} and translation component of the {{XRInputPose/gripMatrix}}. {{XRInputPose/emulatedPosition}} MUST be set to <code>true</code> if positional values are software estimations, such as those provided by a neck or arm model. {{XRInputPose/emulatedPosition}} MUST be set to <code>false</code> if the positional values are based on sensor readings.

Layers {#layers}
======

XRLayer {#xrlayer-interface}
-------

<pre class="idl">
[SecureContext, Exposed=Window] interface XRLayer {};
</pre>

An {{XRLayer}} defines a source of bitmap images and a description of how the image is to be rendered to the [=XR device=]. Initially only one type of layer, the {{XRWebGLLayer}}, is defined but future revisions of the spec may extend the available layer types.

XRWebGLLayer {#xrwebgllayer-interface}
-------

Each {{XRSession}} MUST identify a <dfn>native WebGL framebuffer resolution</dfn>, which is the pixel resolution of a WebGL framebuffer required to match the physical pixel resolution of the [=XR device=].

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="native-webgl-framebuffer-resolution">

The [=native WebGL framebuffer resolution=] is determined by running the following steps:

  1. Let |session| be the target {{XRSession}}.
  1. If |session|'s {{XRSession/mode}} value is not <code>"inline"</code>, set the [=native WebGL framebuffer resolution=] to the resolution required to have a 1:1 ratio between the pixels of a framebuffer large enough to contain all of the session's {{XRView}}s and the physical screen pixels in the area of the display under the highest magnification and abort these steps. If no method exists to determine the native resolution as described, the [=recommended WebGL framebuffer resolution=] MAY be used.
  1. If |session|'s {{XRSession/mode}} value is <code>"inline"</code>, set the [=native WebGL framebuffer resolution=] to the size of the |session|'s {{XRSession/outputContext}}'s {{XRPresentationContext/canvas}} in physical display pixels and reevaluate these steps every time the size of the canvas changes.

</div>

Additionally, the {{XRSession}} MUST identify a <dfn>recommended WebGL framebuffer resolution</dfn>, which represents a best estimate of the WebGL framebuffer resolution large enough to contain all of the session's {{XRView}}s that provides an average application a good balance between performance and quality. It MAY be smaller than, larger than, or equal to the [=native WebGL framebuffer resolution=].

NOTE: The user agent is free to use and method of it's choosing to estimate the [=recommended WebGL framebuffer resolution=]. If there are platform-specific methods for querying a recommended size it is recommended that they be used, but not required.

WebGL Context Compatiblity {#contextcompatibility}
--------------------------

<pre class="idl">
partial dictionary WebGLContextAttributes {
    boolean xrCompatible = null;
};

partial interface mixin WebGLRenderingContextBase {
    Promise&lt;void&gt; makeXRCompatible();
};
</pre>

When a user agent implements this specification it MUST set a <dfn>XR compatible</dfn> boolean, initially set to <code>false</code>, on every {{WebGLRenderingContextBase}}.

In order for a WebGL context to be used as a source for XR imagery it must be created on a <dfn>compatible graphics adapter</dfn> for the [=XR device=]. What is considered a [=compatible graphics adapter=] is platform dependent, but is understood to mean that the graphics adapter can supply imagery to the [=XR device=] without undue latency. If a WebGL context was not already created on the [=compatible graphics adapter=], it typically must be re-created on the adapter in question before it can be used with an {{XRWebGLLayer}}. Once the [=XR compatible=] boolean is set, the context can be used with layers for any {{XRSession}} requested from that [=XR device=].

Note: On an XR platform with a single GPU, it can safely be assumed that the GPU is compatible with the [=XR device=]s advertised by the platform, and thus any hardware accelerated WebGL contexts are compatible as well. On PCs with both an integrated and discreet GPU the discreet GPU is often considered the [=compatible graphics adapter=] since it generally a higher performance chip. On desktop PCs with multiple graphics adapters installed, the one with the [=XR device=] physically connected to it is likely to be considered the [=compatible graphics adapter=].

The [=XR compatible=] boolean can be set either at context creation time or after context creation, potentially incurring a context loss. To set the [=XR compatible=] boolean at context creation time, the {{xrCompatible}} context creation attribute must be set to <code>true</code> when requesting a WebGL context.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="create-with-compatible-xr-device">

When the {{HTMLCanvasElement}}'s getContext() method is invoked with a {{WebGLContextAttributes}} dictionary with {{xrCompatible}} set to <code>true</code>, run the following steps:

  1. [=Create the WebGL context=] as usual, ensuring it is created on a [=compatible graphics adapter=] for the [=XR device=].
  1. Let |context| be the newly created WebGL context.
  1. Set |context|'s [=XR compatible=] boolean to true.
  1. Return |context|.

</div>

<div class="example">
The following code creates a WebGL context that is compatible with an [=XR device=] and then uses it to create an {{XRWebGLLayer}}.

<pre highlight="js">
function onXRSessionStarted(xrSession) {
  let glCanvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  let gl = glCanvas.getContext("webgl", { xrCompatible: true });

  loadWebGLResources();

  xrSession.baseLayer = new XRWebGLLayer(xrSession, gl);
}
</pre>
</div>

To set the [=XR compatible=] boolean after the context has been created, the {{makeXRCompatible()}} method is used.

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="make-xr-compatible">

When the <dfn method for="WebGLRenderingContextBase">makeXRCompatible()</dfn> method is invoked, the user agent MUST return [=a new Promise=] |promise| and run the following steps [=in parallel=]:

  1. Let |context| be the target {{WebGLRenderingContextBase}} object.
  1. If |context|'s [=WebGL context lost flag=] is set, [=reject=] |promise| with an {{InvalidStateError}} and abort these abort these steps.
  1. If |context|'s [=XR compatible=] boolean is <code>true</code>, [=/resolve=] |promise| and abort these steps.
  1. If |context| was created on a [=compatible graphics adapter=] for the [=XR device=]:
      1. Set |context|'s [=XR compatible=] boolean to <code>true</code>.
      1. [=/Resolve=] |promise| and abort these steps.
  1. Queue a task to perform the following steps:
      1. Force |context| to be lost and [=handle the context loss=] as described by the WebGL specification.
      1. If the [=canceled flag=] of the "webglcontextlost" event fired in the previous step was not set, [=reject=] |promise| with an {{AbortError}} and abort these steps.
      1. [=Restore the context=] on a [=compatible graphics adapter=] for the [=XR device=].
      1. Set |context|'s [=XR compatible=] boolean to <code>true</code>.
      1. [=/Resolve=] |promise|.

</div>

<div class="algorithm" data-algorithm="webgl-context-lost">

Additionally, when any WebGL [=handle the context loss|context is lost=] run the following steps prior to firing the "webglcontextlost" event:

  1. Set the context's [=XR compatible=] boolean to <code>false</code>.

</div>

<div class="example">
The following code creates an {{XRWebGLLayer}} from a pre-existing WebGL context.

<pre highlight="js">
let glCanvas = document.createElement("canvas");
let gl = glCanvas.getContext("webgl");

loadWebGLResources();

glCanvas.addEventListener("webglcontextlost", (event) => {
  // Indicates that the WebGL context can be restored.
  event.canceled = true;
});

glCanvas.addEventListener("webglcontextrestored", (event) => {
  // WebGL resources need to be re-created after a context loss.
  loadWebGLResources();
});

function onXRSessionStarted(xrSession) {
  // Make sure the canvas context we want to use is compatible with the device.
  // May trigger a context loss.
  return gl.makeXRCompatible().then(() => {
    xrSession.baseLayer = new XRWebGLLayer(xrSession, gl);
  });

Event Types {#event-types}
-----------

The user agent MUST provide the following new events. Registration for and firing of the events must follow the usual behavior of DOM4 Events.

The user agent MAY fire a <dfn event for="XR">devicechange</dfn> event on the {{XR}} object to indicate that the availability of [=XR device=]s has been changed. The event MUST be of type {{Event}}.

A user agent MAY dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">blur</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} to indicate that presentation to the {{XRSession}} by the page has been suspended by the user agent, OS, or XR hardware. While an {{XRSession}} is <dfn>blurred</dfn> it remains active but it may have its frame production throttled. This is to prevent tracking while the user interacts with potentially sensitive UI. For example: The user agent SHOULD blur the presenting application when the user is typing a URL into the browser with a virtual keyboard, otherwise the presenting page may be able to guess the URL the user is entering by tracking their head motions. The event MUST be of type {{XRSessionEvent}}.

A user agent MAY dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">focus</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} to indicate that presentation to the {{XRSession}} by the page has resumed after being suspended. The event MUST be of type {{XRSessionEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">end</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} when the session ends, either by the application or the user agent. The event MUST be of type {{XRSessionEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">inputsourceschange</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} when the session's [=list of active input sources=] has changed. The event MUST be of type {{XRSessionEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">selectstart</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} when one of its {{XRInputSource}}s begins its [=primary action=]. The event MUST be of type {{XRInputSourceEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">selectend</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} when one of its {{XRInputSource}}s ends its [=primary action=] or when an {{XRInputSource}} that has begun a [=primary action=] is disconnected. The event MUST be of type {{XRInputSourceEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRSession">select</dfn> event on an {{XRSession}} when one of its {{XRInputSource}}s has fully completed a [=primary action=]. The event MUST be of type {{XRInputSourceEvent}}.

A user agent MUST dispatch a <dfn event for="XRFrameOfReference">reset</dfn> event on an {{XRFrameOfReference}} when a discontinuity of the origin occurs, or when the {{boundsGeometry}} changes for a {{XRBoundedFrameOfReference}}. The event MUST be of type {{XRFrameOfReferenceEvent}}, and MUST be dispatched prior to the execution of any [=animation frame=]s that make use of the new origin.
